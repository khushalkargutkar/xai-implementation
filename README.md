# üß† XAI Loan Eligibility System

Welcome to the **XAI Loan Eligibility System**, an interactive demo application showcasing the power of **Explainable AI (XAI)** in financial decision-making. This system evaluates loan eligibility using a transparent machine learning pipeline and generates human-readable rationales using a local language model.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project demonstrates how **XAI** techniques can be integrated into real-world applications. Users submit loan applications via a simple web interface, and the system:

- Predicts loan eligibility using a trained ML model
- Explains the decision using **LIME** (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)
- Generates a natural-language rationale using a local **Phi-3** model via **Ollama**

## üß∞ Tech Stack

| Layer        | Technology Used |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **Frontend** | HTML, CSS, JavaScript (served via FastAPI StaticFiles) |
| **Backend**  | FastAPI, Python 3.11, Uvicorn |
| **ML Model** | scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, ColumnTransformer) |
| **Data**     | pandas, NumPy (synthetic dataset generation) |
| **XAI**      | LIME (local feature attribution) |
| **Database** | SQLite (prediction history) |
| **Validation** | Pydantic v2 |
| **LLM**      | Phi-3 via Ollama (local model for rationale generation) |
| **Infrastructure** | Docker, Docker Compose |
| **Startup**  | Bash (`start.sh` script) |

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The system consists of two main services:

1. **FastAPI Backend**
   - Serves the frontend
   - Hosts ML prediction and explanation logic
   - Stores prediction history in SQLite
   - Calls the local LLM for rationale generation

2. **Phi-3 Model via Ollama**
   - Runs as a separate container
   - Provides a local API for generating natural-language explanations

These services are orchestrated using **Docker Compose** and launched via the `start.sh` script.
